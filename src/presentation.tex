\begin{frame}{Problem Outline}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Modified Othello Game
  \item
    4 randomly removed squares
  \item
    10x10 board rather than the traditional 8x8
  \item
    Network communication with server
  \item
    90 seconds total time per player
  \item
    Design an agent to play intelligently
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Solution Outline}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Static evaluation function based on feature weights
  \item
    Temporal Difference Learning
  \item
    Negamax search with alpha beta pruning
  \item
    Concurrent searching
  \item
    Time management
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Static Evaluation}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Use features weights to evaluate value of board states
  \item
    15 weights for each piece position (based on 8-way symmetry)
  \item
    Weight for mobility - number of moves if it was our turn
  \item
   Weight for stability - number of stable pieces we own
  \item
   Weight for internals - number of internal pieces we own
  \item
   Weight for tokens - total number of tokens we own?
  \item
   Weight for whose turn it is?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Piece Stability}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
  Stability is the inability for a piece to ever be taken
  \item
   All 4 lines must be stable in one direction
  \item
   Line stability from the whole line being 'full'
  \item
   Line stability from the whole direction being stable and full in your favour
  \end{itemize}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{stability.PNG}\\
Stable positions for white
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Piece Internality}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
  A piece is internal if it has no neighbours
  \item
   Harder to dislodge, can result in higher mobility
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Temporal Difference Learning}
Josh to talk about this.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Learning Strategies}
Josh to talk about this.\\
Alpha 0.01\\
E-greedy policy 0.15\\
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Negamax with alpha beta pruning}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Adversarial search algorithm
  \item
    Minmax algorithm modified to negate the value at each step
  \item
    Attempts to maximise reward against adversary who is actively minimising reward
  \item
   $\alpha$ - $\beta$ pruning cuts sections of the game tree that an opponent would never choose
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Negamax features}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Search to a moderate depth if close to the start of the game
  \item
    Search to a deep depth if close to the end of the game
  \item
    Add depth if exploring along a forced move
  \item
    Use static evaluation feature weights to evaluate board value for us minus the board value for the opponent
  \item
    Terminals in our favour worth $\infty$, in opponent's favour worth $-\infty$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Concurrency}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Everyone loves concurrency. Concurrency has everyone's children.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Time management}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Lower depth based on amount of time left
  \item
    Emergency feature - Below 15 seconds, revert to depth 2 - we can see enemy moves as they come, but not much further ahead
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Observations}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Because of the removed squares, piece stability became especially important ahead
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Other ideas}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Use monte carlo prediction as a substitute for reward to help with learning of mid-game states
  \item
    Optimised search ordering - expand nodes by their value in our piece feature weights
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Winning Speech}
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Friends, family, wives, pets, neighbours etc.
  \item
   Beyonce has one of the greatest videos of all time. Of all time!
  \item
   Other groups played well but we can't all be winners
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
